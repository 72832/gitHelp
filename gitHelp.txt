If you have already done setup(which you can ask me to do), then 
whenever you start coding do a:

"cd ~/lemonade"
        ^ Or whatever your code directory/ repository is named

--This changes the current working directory to lemonade

"git pull"

--This pulls your most current(hopefully) version of code from 
github.com

Then as you continue whenever you get code that works I would suggest 
doing a commit. Also whenever you are done do a commit before you push. 
To do a commit do:

"git commit -a -m "working code: nov 3" "
                      ^ This "String" is what the commit is named
                ^ -m : includes a message that is what the commit is 
named

             ^ -a : adds everything that you have done.
 
      ^ is the proogram function that allows you to commit your code


When you are done just do:

"git push"
